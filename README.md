# COEN 129 - Machine Learning Final Project
Here is the final version of our Machine Learning project for our COEN 129 class (Current Topics in Computer Engineering).  

Project Guidelines:
- Pick a real-world problem, describe your dataset, define your machine learning problem, apply a machine learning technique, and present the results. You are highly encouraged to use a large-scale dataset, i.e., at least 100K data instances.
- Projects can be done individually, or in teams of two students. For a group, group members are responsible for dividing up the work equally and making sure that each member contributes.
- If you are having trouble writinga proposalor executing the project, please feel free to consult withthe instructor.


File Description:

- In dataSet.py, we get all the data from the quandl dataset that we want, and store it in a text file, foo.txt.
- In features.py, we use the data in foo.txt to predict the future stock prices.
